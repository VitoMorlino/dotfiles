How to create a symlink (internally-readable shortcut)

	On Windows, use the command "mklink NewLinkLocation PathToTarget" 
	- NewLinkLocation = The location where the newly created SymLink should be created
	- PathToTarget = The location of the file/directory
	- Add a "/d" after "mklink" to create a directory link rather than a single-file link
	- NOTE: Windows requires backslashes in paths, like this "C:\Users\Name\File"

	On Linux/Mac, use ln instead of mklink
