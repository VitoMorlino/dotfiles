# what's a dotfiles..?
The settings files for many services are stored in files/folders whose names start with a dot, which is where we get the name "dotfiles"
>The reason for the dot is a remnant of early UNIX file systems. To make it easier to navigate the filesystem, an empty file named `.` was automatically created in each directory as a shortcut to represent that directory. Another empty file named `..` was added as a shortcut to one directory up in the structure.
>Since these were just empty helper files, they didn't need to be listed when the user wanted a list of files in a directory. So, a change was made to the `ls` binary that ignored files starting with a `.` when listing the contents of a directory. Problem solved.
>What they didn't expect, however, was that this would also hide other files. The change to `ls` was basically "if the file name starts with `.`, don't list it." and they didn't anticipate that actual files might start with a `.` and that those files wouldn't be listed either. The result is what we now know as "hidden files"
